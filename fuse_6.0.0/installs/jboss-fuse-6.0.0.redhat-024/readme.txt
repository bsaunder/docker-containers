JBoss Fuse
-------------------

Security Prerequisites
----------------------
By default, no users are defined for the container. You can run the container in the
foreground in this case, but you will not be able to access the container remotely and you will
not be able to run it in the background.

To enable remote access to the container, you must create at least one user in
the ./etc/users.properties file. It is recommended that you create at least one user
with the admin role by adding a line with the following syntax:

<Username>=<Password>,admin

The admin role grants full administration privileges to the user.

To make the container's JMX port and ActiveMQ Web console accessible, modify the 
following lines of the ./etc/system.properties file to use the credentials of one 
of the users from the users.properties file:

activemq.jmx.user=<Username>
activemq.jmx.password=<Password>
